## Hi there, I'm Roman! 👋🏾

I'm a product designer who thrives on crafting seamless digital experiences that move people. I'm currently on the Design Engineer track, learning frontend software development.

My first computer interaction was GTA Vice City, because, of course. Since then, I’ve explored nearly every corner of tech — coding, cybersecurity, you name it — before finding my groove in design. When I’m not deep in Figma, I’m probably roaming Nairobi (or Los Santos), shooting hoops, reading, burning dinner in the name of “cooking,” or doom-scrolling with purpose.
